Welcome to the unofficial micro:bit v2 documentation repository. The source for all pages and styles for the documentation website is housed on branch `master`, and the currently live version of the site is stored on branch `gh-pages`.

## Building
This site uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) to build static content, and Github Actions to deploy. You can install Hugo through your system's package manager, or through the [official download page](). To serve a local copy of the site, simply run:
```bash
hugo serve
```
